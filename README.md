# GiphyTastic
This web app uses the Giphy API via AJAX to pull 20 animal images upon the click of a button.
You can add another animal to the list by completing the search box with the name of the animal.
If you click on an image, the image animates and if you click again, the image stops moving.
Enjoy!
